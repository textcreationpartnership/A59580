            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ALthough the greateſt Princes, with their dependant Governments and Intereſts, are expoſed to change, yet <hi>Truth</hi> is not: This ſtands on ſuch a firm Baſis, that, that which was once <hi>Truth,</hi> whether in <hi>Rome, Geneva</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> is ſtill ſo, and will be ſo for ever. And therefore, how propitious and indulgent ſoever, the publick Revolution of Affairs may prove to the corrupt Luſts and Intereſts of Men ſeditiouſly minded, the <hi>Truth</hi> will always be their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and bid defiance to them: and ſuch is the mighty and irreſiſtible force thereof, that it will even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually conquer and triumph over all their Sophiſtical reaſonings, and enthrone it ſelf in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Conſciences, for Converſion or Confuſion. That Catholick Doctrine, which is aſſerted and contended for in theſe Papers, hath been, is, and will be for a Crown of rejoycing to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Religion being conſtituted of a ſtedfaſt Allegiance to her Princes, as well as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Devotion to her God, it cannot be diſclaimed and renounced without a plain Apoſtacy from her Communion, which is matter of abhorrence to all good Chriſtians: and yet ſuch is the boldneſs, I had almoſt ſaid, Impudence of ſome bigotted, pirking Fanaticks, that for many Months together, they have attempted with great diligence to ridicule and expoſe it to ſcorn and contempt: and one of them having mounted and ſettled himſelf in the Seat of the Scornful, made it part of his <hi>Morning Exerciſe,</hi> to inſinuate amongſt other ſediticus Things, That the Preaching thereof, is one of thoſe national Sins we are to repent of, in expectation of national Mercies, becauſe a Doctrine deſigned to enſlave the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Slavery with them, being an equivalent to a reſtraint from the Liberty of an armed Reſiſtance of their Prince, when they ſhall judge it neceſſary, and themſelves well prepared for it. Indeed, another of them for part of his <hi>Morning Exerciſe,</hi> aſſumes the Confidence, to publiſh to the World, That they are miſrepreſented, when reported as <hi>Enemies to Monarchy,</hi> becauſe they have given aſſurance by Oath of their Allegiance to it; but if the <hi>one</hi> be fit to be an Interpreter to the <hi>other</hi> (as no doubt but he is, they being of the ſame Confederacy, and bound up in the ſame bundle together) their Allegiance is only during pleaſure, which they will term, ſo long as your Majeſties Behaviours and Adminiſtrations are ſuch as they ſhould be, that is, ſuch as they ſhall well like and approve of: The naked Truth is this, their Friendſhip and Fidelity to your Majeſties Perſons and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verments is only founded on what they apprehend to be beneficence to their private Opinions, and conſequent Affections and Intereſts; for the Proof of which their Deportments under the late Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of publick Affairs, is an evidence even to a Demonſtration; their factious Deſigns and Practices being the ſole Standards and Meaſures of what they repute good and evil, all publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations are Objects of their election or reprobation, agreeably to that ſubſerviency or contrariety they bear to them: So that, if you ſerve them, they will ſerve you: but if you oppoſe and ſuppreſs them, they will oppoſe and ſuppreſs you, if they can. Wherefore, if your Majeſties will be ſecured from their rebellious Inſurrections againſt your Government, you muſt let them do always that which is right in their own eyes, and never diſpleaſe them. Abrogate the Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity and the Teſts, Renounce Supremacy in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, and extirpate Prelacy as well as Popery (the continuation of all which with them are national Sins) raiſe up and ſet on foot the ſolemn League and Covenant, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap> and bring the Epiſcopal Clergy to ſuch a Temper, that they may paſs for
<pb facs="tcp:35537:3"/>Men tollerable in the Church, and if no body anger them, they will be very quiet. But Your Majeſties muſt remember, that they are Abhorrors of the <hi>Doctrine of Non-Reſiſtance</hi> as well as of the Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, the Sacramental Teſt, Epiſcopacy, Liturgy and Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes; and therefore muſt keep your ſelves in the poſture of Gladiators; for if the publick Adminiſtrations chance to be oppreſſive in their Apprehenſions and Judgments to their natural, civil or ſpiritual Rights and Priviledges, with which they are more richly ſtored than their Neighbours, they will be your Subjects no longer than they are ſtrong enough to be your Maſters, and the Depoſition of your Majeſties in order to the Exaltation of their <hi>own Diſcipline,</hi> which they will call the <hi>Scepter of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhall be reputed a Mercy as conſiderable as a <hi>Fifth of November's Deliverance.</hi> It can be no matter of wonder to your Majeſties, that thoſe Men, who will <hi>ſtill have this lain down for a Principle, That in all the Diſputes between Power and Liberty, Power muſt be proved, but Liberty proves it ſelf; the one being founded only on poſitive Law, and the other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Law of Nature;</hi> that they caution your Subjects againſt examining the Matter of Regal Power by the Scriptures; for if we are reſolved to ſtick to them as the Rules of our belief and practice in this caſe, we ſhall find the Power of Kings founded on another Bottom and Conſtitution, than that theſe Men have invented and commended to the World; for the Scriptures do aſſure us, That not only thoſe who reigned over God's own peculiar People did Reign immediately from and by him. <hi>Acts 7.35. Numb. 27.16, 18. Judg. 2.16. 1 Sam. 10.1.

And as the firſt Dominion and Government of Divine Ordination was Monarchical, ſo we have no reaſon to think, that it was God's intention, that, that Species or Form of Government ſhould be altered, and another introduced, becauſe we have no inſtance of any other Government, either of his immediate Ordination or Approbation; and ſo far as I am inſtructed in divine Revelations, we have no Rule for the Eſtabliſhing of any other Form of Government, nor direct precept to ſubmit to any other as of his preſcribing: and when Men prefer their own Inventions before divine Inſtitutions, they bring forth as <hi>Aaron</hi> did, a <hi>Calf</hi> inſtead of a <hi>God:</hi> The Church of <hi>England</hi> having deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, That, <hi>the moſt high and ſacred Order of Kings is of divine Right, being the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God him elf, founded in the prime Laws of Nature, and clearly eſtabliſhed by expreſs Texts both of the Old and New Teſtaments,</hi> thoſe pretended Sons of the Church need good foreheads, who preſume to affirm them to be their <hi>Peoples Creatures,</hi> and to owe their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power ſolely to them, and ought to exerciſe no more than they have by their Conceſſion. I hope God hath ſuch Grace and Mercy in ſtore for this Church and Kingdom, that he will raiſe up Men of greater Abilities, and better Opportunities than can be pretended unto by my ſelf, to defend the crowned Heads thereof from ſuch Aſſailants: but if theſe enſuing Diſcourſes in any meaſure prove a Countermine to their deſignments, and contribute any degree of aſſiſtance towards the Security of the Publick Government, I ſhall aſcribe all the Honour thereof unto God, and Your Majeſties will have no reaſon to diſcountenance the Honeſt, though Weak, Endeavours of</p>

            <p>THE grand Deſign of Religion is the Reſignation of our ſelves to God, that it may be well with us, both in this world and that which is to come; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Appearance of the bleſſed Jeſus is repreſented as bringing <hi>Glory to God on high, on Earth Peace, good Will towards Men.</hi> And the <hi>well-being</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in this World, greatly depending on the Safety and Peace of publick Societies, the Chriſtian Religion hath a ſpecial Regard to the Protection and Preſervation of them: And, Civil Authority being under God, a moſt efficacious Inſtrument thereof, ſignal care is taken for its ſecurity, that it be not weakened or diſturbed in its being and exerciſe, but main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and obſerved by all that are ſubjected thereunto, as my Text with its coherence doth abundantly evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. In the former Verſe, the Apoſtle chargeth it as a Duty incumbent on all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to be ſubject to the Higher Powers; <hi>Let every Soul</hi> [every one without exception or reſervation] <hi>be Subject</hi> [yield Submiſſion and Obedience] <hi>to the Higher Powers</hi> [the lawful Poſſeſſors and Adminiſtrators of Supreme Authority;] for, though the Word <hi>[Powers]</hi> be in the Abſtract, yet we are to underſtand them concretively, as ſignifying the Perſons which exerciſe Authority. And 'tis ordinary in Scripture by a Metonymical Phraſe to put the Abſtract for the Concrete, the Adjunct for the Subject, which was not here unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed, becauſe the Deſign of the Apoſtle is to aſcertain us, that every Perſon under Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of what Rank or Order ſoever he be, is obliged to yield Subjection to his legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supreme Governour, howſoever he be qualified for his Religion or moral Deportment.</p>

And the Reaſon he gives doth equally effect all Subjects, and equally relate to all that are advanced to Supreme Authority; <hi>for there is no Power but of God, and the Powers that be are ordained of God;</hi> that is, the Original of all Authority is from God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, whoſoever partakes of it is to be acknowledged as God's Commiſſioner to rule and govern all that are placed in a State of Subjection to him; and, although we are to be ſubject and obedient to the Officer for his Office-ſake, yet our Subjection and Obedience immediately refers to the Officer himſelf, becauſe we are ruled and governed by the Officer,
[<hi>i. e.</hi> by a Man inveſted with, and exerciſing Authority over us] and not ſimply by an Office, which abſtructively conſidered, is utterly ineffective to all the Purpoſes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as 'tis not the Kingſhip which makes and executes Laws, but the King: 'tis not the Portrieveſhip, or the Conſtableſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> the bare Office in either reſpect, but the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve and the Conſtable, which ſuppreſs Diſorder, and adminiſter Juſtice in any caſe.</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. 1. I will endeavour to evince, that the Allowance of Liberty to Subjects to reſiſt the Sovereign Power is againſt the Principles of Common Reaſon, and that in divers Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis againſt Common Reaſon, That the Higher Powers ſhould be reſiſted by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Force of Inferiours and Subjects, becauſe the Allowance of ſuch a Thing would render all ſetled Government impracticable, and indeed impoſſible; and conſequently deſtroy all the Means deviſable for Adminiſtring Public Juſtice, ſecuring Private and Public Rights and Properties, and preſerving the Peace and Proſperity of all Human Societies. The Primary End of all Government is to procure and preſerve the Peace of Human Societies, and where this cannot be ſufficiently provided for, the Government is null'd and deſtroyed which is the Caſe under conſideration. For if it be allowable for Subjects in any caſe, and upon any pretence whatſoever to reſiſt the Sovereign Powers with armed Force, then it follows, that they have a right to judge in what caſes 'tis fit for them to ſubmit, and in what caſes 'tis fit and lawful for them to reſiſt; and then the Subjects are the Supream Judges of the Government and their Governours, which undeniably implies, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are bound to Subjection, only ſo long as they themſelves think fit, and conſequently may claim and exerciſe Authority and Judicature over their Governors, and paſs Judgment upon them and their Government, whenſoever they ſhall think it needful or requiſite ſo to do. And being to judge for themſelves, 'tis very probable they will judge favourably for themſelves. And whereever the Supremacy of Judgment reſides, there is the Sovereign Authority and Power, wherefore if the Higher Powers may be judged by their Subjects, they are not Supream, but Subordinate, and Rule meerly precariouſly, even ſo long, and no longer than their Superiour Judges will give them leave ſo to do. And when Men are in effect Subject to no Authority and Power, but that of their own Judgments and Wills, a Foundation is laid for a General and Great Confuſion. Where all will be Sovereigns, who ſhall be the Subjects? Where all are to command, there are none to obey. Let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Men Liberty to judge for themſelves, when 'tis fit they ſhould be ſubject to the Higher Powers, and when
'tis not, and they may at Pleaſure diſſolve any Government in the World. There is therefore no one Law ſo beneficial to the Subject, as this Fundamental. Law of Sovereignity, <hi>That 'tis unreſiſtible and unaccountable for its determinations, and from which there is no appeal.</hi> For though a Society may be Governed by Mutual Conſent and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet let Sovereign Authority and Power be lodged in one or many Perſons, it muſt be <hi>abſolute and uncontroulable,</hi> or elſe thoſe Differences and Controverſies which ariſe in that Society, can never be decided, and finally determined. And whatever unthinking Men may fancy, the Security of the Public Government from the Reſiſtance of its Subjects, is the beſt Security of every Mans Liberty, Property and Safety.</p>
            <p>

Let the Public Government be once Invaded and Confronted by the Open Reſiſtance and Defiance of its Subjects, and we are unavoidably and immediately in a State of War, and then no Man hath any thing, he can call his own; and all the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Juſtice are ſtopped; and in truth, all Laws lay dead, and are ineffective to the Purpoſes of Government. Wherefore if we ſet aſide all regard to Duty and Honeſty, and do but conſider our own intereſt; quiet and ſafety, we ſhall find Submiſſion to the worſt Government more for the Eaſe and Security of the Subject than Rebellion and War. Let any Man of Common Ingenuity and Senſe conſider, if a State of War be not the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs, and deplorable condition in the World; for in ſuch a Caſe no Mans Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt can be ſecured againſt the Injuries and Violences of other Men; and when a Man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35537:6"/>hath loſt his Proprieties and Safety, what hath he more to loſe? And yet this is the Caſe when Men endeavour to ſhake off Submiſſion to the Higher Powers, by a Forcible Reſiſtance of them; they pull down all thoſe incloſures by which their own Quiet, Propriety and Safety were defended and protected.</p>

Were Reſiſtance of Authority never ſo lawful, 'tis ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of Public Grievances as never did or will bear its own Charges, and whatever Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or People uſed it, paid a Severe Reckoning for it, and lamented their Folly and Raſhneſs. The Miſcarriages, Oppreſſions and Tyrannies of a Single Perſon, are finite and reach but to particular caſes: but the Miſeries of War are endleſs and univerſal. And whatever the Event be, or whoever wins the Prize contended for, the Common-wealth is ſure to be a loſer by it; and the Generality never reap any thing from it, but repentance and a dear bought experience of the Inſolence of Souldiers, who with drawn Swords rate the Merits of their Services, and are not eaſily pleaſed, unleſs they take whatever they demand. If Princes may, and do abuſe their Power, 'tis much more certain, that the Rabble neither can or will uſe theirs aright.</p>

Where we acknowgledge a Sovereign Authority, there we yeild Subjection and Obedience; from the one flows the other as an effect from the Cauſe: but where we reſiſt a Power, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and renounce the Sovereignity of it, for we reſiſt it that we may not be under but above it.

As there is no Power but of God, ſo there is no Power but is Gods: and the Subordination of Subjects to their Sovereign, being of Divine Ordination, the Subordination is to God himſelf; and therefore Subjects are not only obliged quietly to abide under the Predominant Force and Strength of their Sovereign, but likewiſe to make a Voluntary Reſignation of themſelves, their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, Wills, Powers and Intereſts to his directive Wiſdom and preceptive Will, actively obeying what he juſtly impoſeth, or paſſively enduring what he inflicts for Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.

'Tis manifeſt, That the Prieſts as well as <hi>Saul</hi> were <hi>Anointed</hi> by God's Command, and yet that did not exempt from being accountable for their Actions, and free them from the Danger of coercive Force and Puniſhment: It was not therefore barely the Ceremony of <hi>Anointing,</hi> but the Sovereign Authority thereby ſignified which priviledg'd him from Reſiſtance. His <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> was no addition to his Power, but only ſignified God's Deſignation, Conſtitution and Approbation of his Power: 'Twas the Nature of his Regal Dignity and Power, and not the manner of collating or conferring it which exempted from coercion and correction: 'Tis the Eſſence and not the Ceremonies of Things which conſtitutes and denominates them: For Ceremonies are things extrinſecal both to Being and Operation.

For <hi>there is no Power but of God.</hi> And therefore <hi>by him only</hi> [Authority immediately derived from him] <hi>do all the Kings in the World Reign, and Princes decree Juſtice,</hi> who are Supream and Sovereign Kings and Princes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.15. when therefore 'tis ſaid, that <hi>all the People made Saul King,</hi> 1 Sam. 11.15. <hi>and anointed David King,</hi> 2. Sam. 2.4. <hi>and made Solomon the Son of David King.</hi> 1 Chron. 29.22. the Meaning is, they made a Declaration that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and acknowledged, that they were their Kings. For they were all Kings before, by the eſpecial Appointment of God himſelf, and could thereby derive no Authority or Power from the People, only this voluntary acknowledgment rendred the Exerciſe of their Office the more grateful to themſelves and the People. Which may be (as formerly intimated) illuſtrated by the chuſing of Mayors, Sheriffs, Stewards, Bayliffs, and other Officers in Corporate Towns and Cities, where the Perſons choſen receive no Office or Authority from the Electors, but wholly derive it from the King's Charter. So all the higher Powers are God's Ordinance and not the Peoples. And therefore the higher Powers are dignified with God's own Name, Pſ. 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods.</hi> Becauſe they are his Vice-gerents, and act in his Name, and what they ſo do, God doth by them; and therefore, 'tis ſaid, <hi>He judgeth among the Gods,</hi> Pſ. 82.1. and their Throne is called <hi>the Throne of the Lord,</hi> 1 Chr. 29.22. And they are ſaid <hi>to judge not for Man but for the Lord,</hi> 2 Chr. 19.6. which is a convictive Evidence, that the Supream Powers depend immediately upon God only for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35537:15"/>their Dignities and Authorities. And hence by the Stile of our Laws, the King being the Supream Power, is <hi>Rex Dei gratia, King by the Grace of God,</hi> becauſe he owes his Sovereign Dominion to God alone, and is to be accountable for it only to him. And the Statute of 16 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. thus declares, <hi>That the Crown of England hath been ſo free at all times, that it hath been in no earthly ſubjection, but immediately ſubject to God in all things touching the Regality of the ſame Crown and to no other.</hi> And the King being God's immediate Subſtitute, and exerciſing Dominion and Authority next, and immediately under him; as he that reſiſteth the King's Vice-Roy, reſiſteth the King, ſo he that reſiſteth the King, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God.</p>

We are as peremptorily commanded to <hi>fear</hi> the King, as to <hi>fear</hi> the Lord, Pr. 24.21. <hi>Fear the Lord and the King.</hi> And what God hath joyned together, we muſt not put aſunder. We muſt fear to diſpleaſe the one as well as the other: fear to diſpleaſe the King, becauſe we fear to diſpleaſe the Lord: For God hath made this fear as properly due to the King, as the moſt Legal Cuſtom or Tribute which is paid to him, Rom. 13.7. <hi>Render therefore to all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour.</hi> And he cannot be reſtrain'd with this Fear, who Aſſaults his King with Force. Elſewhere we are commanded to <hi>Honour the King,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.17. <hi>Fear God: Honour the King.</hi> Where the Fear of God is lain as the Foundation of a Mans actings towards the King, Honour to the King will be the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure: Piety neceſſarily diſpoſeth to Loyalty, becauſe our obligations to God comprehend our obligations to the King, and the prime Perſwaſive Motives to diſcharge our Duty to the King, are inferr'd from the Duty we owe to God. Hence we are required to <hi>ſubmit to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's ſake; whether it be to the King as Supream, or unto Governors, as to thoſe that are ſent by him; why? For ſo is the Will of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. and ſo in the Place before quoted, <hi>v.</hi> 7. of this <hi>ch. we muſt be ſubject for conſcience ſake.</hi> Wherefore the moſt viſible and immediate Evidence we can poſſibly give for our fearing of God is, that, we Honour the King. And for my part, I cannot but fear, <hi>That they who do not obey the King, who is a viſible God, that they do not heartily obey God who is an inviſible King. For he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.20.</p>

Thoſe whom God haith raiſed into a Communion with himſelf in the Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Authority and Power, and are exerciſed in high Employments under him, they are to be raiſed high in our Eſtimations of them, and are to be held in great reputation for God's ſake; but how can we value them highly, whom we violently oppoſe? As he honours his Father and Mother who ſubmits to their Government, ſo he diſhonours them who reſiſts and rejects it. He that did but uncover his Fathers nakedneſs which expoſed him to contempt and ſcorn, though he did not try Maſteries with him, was curſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.25. and <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>that the Eye that mocketh at his Father and diſdaineth to obey his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Ravens of the Valley ſhall pick it out, and the young Eagles ſhall eat it,</hi> Pr. 30.17. that is, they ſhall come to an untimely death, and be denied Burial, as Traitors to the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Government of our Country are, and thereby expoſed to be devoured by ravenous Birds. And <hi>the Stubborn and Rebellious Son, which would not obey the Voice of his Father and Mother,</hi> tho' he did not Aſſault them with Force of Arms, endeavour to thruſt them out of doors, or to ſubject them to his diſorderly paſſions; yet he was to be <hi>condemned by the Elders and ſtoned to Death,</hi> Deut. 21.21. and can you believe, that he is leſs faulty that diſhonours and diſobeys his civil Parents, who are the nurſing Fathers of his Country, than he which diſhonours and diſobeys his natural Parents? Whatſoever is eſſential to the Paternal Power belongs to the Regal: and whatſoever Authority is in a diſperſed manner found amongſt any ſort of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour

Acts 23.5. and if we muſt hold our Tongues from Violence, I'm ſure we muſt hold our Hands from Violence againſt him. I take this to be an unanſwerable Argument for <hi>Non-reſiſtance:</hi> for if it be unlawful to diſhonour and affront the King with words,
'tis much more ſo to do it with blows. When St. <hi>Jude</hi> characterizeth ſome of the worſt Men, and vileſt Hereticks of that Age, he deſcribes them by this infallible Mark of infamous Criminals, <hi>That they deſpiſe Dominion, and ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> v. 8. Yet further, God doth not only reſtrain from doing and ſpeaking evil, but alſo from thinking evil of the King, Eccl. 10.20. <hi>Curſe not the King, no, not in thy thought.</hi> If we muſt not curſe him, we muſt not curb him: if we muſt not wiſh him any harm, we muſt not deſtroy him. And 'tis a received Rule for the Interpretation of all Scripture Prohibitions of ſin, <hi>That when any ſin is expreſly forbidden the contrary Duty is implicitely commanded.</hi> When therefore we are forbid to ſpeak evil of the King, we are commanded to ſpeak honourably of him: And when we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to curſe him, we are commanded to bleſs him. That is, to acknowledge his Excellency, magnifying him <hi>as worth ten thouſand of us,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.3. pray for his welfare, crying out, <hi>God ſave the King?</hi> 1 Sam. 10.24. 2 Sam. 16.16. 2 Kings 11.12. 2 Chron. 23.11. and to miniſter to him in all Offices of well-doing for him to the utmoſt of our Power, ſaying with Mephiboſheth, <hi>Let them take all, that the King may be at his Houſe in Peace,</hi> 2 Sam. 19.30. and anſwerably, we are commanded <hi>not to meddle with them that are given to change,</hi> Pro. 24.21. that is, with ſeditious ſpirited Men, who affect to make inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in Matters of Government, to the Diſturbance of the King's Peace.

It commands us to <hi>ſtudy to be quiet,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.11. <hi>to follow Peace with all Men,</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>and if it be poſſible, and as much as in us lyeth to live peaceably with all Men,</hi> Rom. 12.18. <hi>to pray that we may lead quiet and peaceable lives,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.2. if there are therefore any buſie-bodies amongſt us, Religion doth not employ them: if there be Controverſies, Schiſms and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions amongſt us, Religion doth not raiſe or grant indulgences to them: if there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and warrings, Religion doth not blow the Trumpet or beat up the Drum, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and encourage them, but engageth all its Powers to ſet up as a Bulwork againſt them a quite contrary diſpoſition to them, and where they prevail, they deſtroy all thoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and luſts which incline and irritate to wars and fightings, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, to 25. and will allow nothing to be done through ſtrife and vain glory, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3. yea further, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is ſo far from countenancing a violent Reſiſtance of injurious Superiours, that it forbids a vindictive Reſiſtance of equals, Mat. 5.38. <hi>ye have heard</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>that it hath been ſaid, an Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth: but I ſay unto you, that ye reſiſt not evil</hi> (that is in the Apoſtles words, <hi>that ye render not evil for evil,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.15.) <hi>but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

But the Evangelical Diſpenſation condemneth this ſeverity, and ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens all that ſubmit to it into ſuch meekneſs, gentleneſs, patience and forbearance, that they readily prefer a quiet Submiſſion to an Injury before a paſſionate Execution of Revenge, and will take two blows rather than retaliate one, ſuffer the greateſt wrong rather than do the leaſt, part with their Clokes as well as their Coats, remit their Rights rather than uſe their Liberty as a cloke of Maliciouſneſs to implead before the Magiſtrate, and if they are compelled to go a Mile beyond their proportion and legal ſhare, they will go two, rather than contend and reſiſt, yea, they will go as far as the Shoes of the Preparation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Peace can carry them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.39, 40, 41. and the contrary Practice of the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and litigious <hi>Corinthians</hi> was ſmartly reprehended by the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 6.5, 6, 7. <hi>there is utterly a Fault among you, becauſe ye go to Law one with another: why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather ſuffer your ſelves to be defrauded?</hi> And he tells them that he ſpake this to their ſhame. And good reaſon they had to be aſham'd of it, for wrathful, malicious and revengeful Proſecutions are moſt directly contrary to the Spirit, Scope and Deſign of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity which conſiſts in ſelf-denial, taking up of the Croſs, patience, meekneſs, mutual forbearance, loving our Enemies, bleſſing them that curſe us, doing good to them that hate us, praying for them that deſpitefully uſe us, forgiving treſpaſſes againſt us, and overcoming evil with good. And as we are to agree with our Adverſaries and forgive them, ſo we are to do all we can to bring others to the ſame temper and communion with us in this caſe; and therefore the Peace-makers as well as the meek and peaceable are bleſſed, Mat. 5.9. <hi>bleſſed are the Peace-makers, for they ſhall be called the Children of God,</hi> and if Peace-makers are bleſled, then Peace-breakers are curſed: and if Peace-makers ſhall be mentioned as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Imitators of God, then Peace-breakers ſhall be mentioned as the Children and Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of the Devil.</p>

Theſe things duly conſidered, I conceive, it may be warrantably concluded, that 'tis unlawful for Subjects in any caſe whatſoever to reſiſt the Sovereign Power with armed Force. How ſo? If they ought not to be overcome of evil, muſt not be prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly provoked by the injurious deportments of Private Perſons like themſelves to avenge themſelves, but muſt refer the Work of Vengeance to God and his Vice-gerents, to whom it alone belongs; then certainly they cannot be allowed to avenge themſelves on their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, who are Public Perſons, and only have the Sovereign Right to the Sword of vindictive Juſtice. Where a leſſer Power is forbidden, a greater cannot be allowed: he that hath not Liberty to Aſſault his Brother, cannot have a Commiſſion to beat his Father or Rebel againſt his Prince: he that muſt not uſurp the Sovereign Power againſt an equal or an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour muſt not uſurp it, to turn it againſt the Sovereign himſelf. If this were allowed, Sovereign Powers would be the moſt deſpicable Subjects in the World, they would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to thoſe revenges from which all the reſt of Mankind are exempted. The Apoſtle tells us, Jam. 1.20. <hi>that the wrath of Man, worketh not the righteouſneſs of God,</hi> that is, under what diſguiſes ſoever the vindictive Wrath of Man appeareth, it never executeth any part of Juſtice which God requireth or approveth, but worketh all manner of evil. <hi>For where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evil work,</hi> Jam. 3.16. <hi>for he loveth tranſgreſſion that loveth ſtrife,</hi> Pro. 17.19. and he will ſurely do what he loveth to do.</p>

'Tis evident, that we owe Paſſive as well as Active Obedience to the higher Powers. Where there is a Sovereign Power, there is a Power of Life and Death: and the Subjects are equally obliged to ſubmit to it in both reſpects. When God gave Nebuchadnezzar <hi>a Kingdom and Majeſty— for the Majeſty that he gave him all People—trembled and feared before him. Whom he would, he ſlew, and whom he would, he kept alive: and whom he would, he ſet up: and whom he would, he pulled down,</hi> Dan. 5.18, 19. and all Sovereign Princes and States in the World, partake of the like Authority and Power, and their Subjects ought to own and ſubmit themſelves thereunto. Fear being the moſt Commodious Inſtrument of Civil Government, the Obſervation of Human Laws is ordinarily enforced with greater or leſſer Penalties, as beſt ſubſerve their ſeveral Ends and Uſes. If therefore the directive Part of the Law be violated, the Penal is to be executed on the Tranſgreſſor. And it ſometimes happens, that Rulers which ought to be a terrour to Evil Works, are on the contrary, a terrour to Good Works. For by enacting Laws contrary to the Law of God, they repute thoſe Traitors to their King, who are Loyal to their God, and condemn the Juſt whom God juſtifieth; and having as much Power to puniſh the violation of Laws as to enact them, their Subjects are bound to ſubmit thereunto without Reſiſtance. And though this be an abuſe of their Power, and they have no warranty from God for it, yet 'tis their own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they abuſe, and their Subjects muſt ſuffer it, and can pretend to no right by armed Force to reſiſt and redreſs it, becauſe there cannot be a lawful Superiour Power to that which is Supream. Now in ſuch a Caſe when we durſt not yield and perform an active Obedience in doing what is commanded, becauſe ſuch a Submiſſion to Man is a Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, we muſt yield and perform a Paſſive Obedience, in ſubmitting patiently and quietly to the puniſhment inflicted, becauſe ſuch a Submiſſion to Man is a Reſignation of our ſelves to God, and a partaking with Jeſus Chriſt as our Fore-runner in his ſufferings, which the Apoſtle expreſly calls <hi>ſuffering as a Chriſtian,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.16.</p>

When a Man ſuffers no more than what he deſerves and common Juſtice requires, there is nothing of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or gloriation in it: <hi>but if when ye do well and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God. And this is thank-worthy, if a Man for Conſcience towards God endure grief, ſuffering wrongfully,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.19, 20. and ch. 4.15. he ſuffers only <hi>as a Chriſtian who ſuffers wrongfully for well-doing;</hi> and then follows Chriſt's ſteps in conforming to the Manner of his ſufferings, when his ſufferings are a probation to his patience; but no provocation to his revenge, will not defend himſelf from an unjuſt puniſhment, by an undutiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>

Moreover whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called: and whom he called them he alſo juſtified: and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> In which Words is repreſented the Method, Order and Degrees of God's Decrees, Diſpenſations and Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Effecting of our Salvation according to the Terms of the Goſpel; and they ſhew the inviolable connexion betwixt God's acceptance of us, as objects of his ſpecial love and our conformity unto Chriſt: and that according to the immutable ordination of God, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever anſwers the Call of the Goſpel, and obtains juſtification and glorification according to the Purport and Tenour of it, he muſt reſemble Chriſt in his doings and ſufferings. And this is likewiſe the expreſs Doctrine of Chriſt himſelf, Mat. 16.24. <hi>If any Man will come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, let him take up his Croſs and follow me.</hi> No wearing of a Crown with him, but by bearing his Croſs after him, Luke 26.16. <hi>ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things, and to enter</hi> [ſo and upon ſuch Terms] <hi>into his glory?</hi> And our way of enterance thereinto is the ſame, Luke. 22.29. <hi>therefore I appoint unto you a Kingdom</hi> [after the ſame manner and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Terms] <hi>as my Father hath appointed unto me.

And may we not be well enough contented to be allowed admittance into the Kingdom of Heaven the ſame way with him? This is the Evangelical ſtated way of Salvation, and to a <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity hereunto are all Chriſtians called: becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for them, leaving them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that they ſhould follow his ſteps,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. <hi>who when he was oppreſſed and afflicted opened not his Mouth: when he was reviled, reviled not again: but was brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep before her Sharers is dumb, ſo open'd he not his Mouth,</hi> Iſa. 53.7.

That no more Authority and Power is to be claimed and exerciſed by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes than can proved, and that the Liberty of the Subject proves it ſelf, doth not only imply, that all Authority and Power is from mutual Contracts and Agreements, but alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Judgment of ſuch Men, that all Authority and Power is radically and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in every ſingle Perſon: and therefore I take it to be a moſt groundleſs and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preſumption: If <hi>Power muſt always be proved, but Liberty proves it ſelf,</hi> the Caſe of the Sovereign is very lamentable and deſpicable; for how is Power to be proved? by what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? by the Princes own Teſtimony, or by the Teſtimony of the Subject?

            <p>1. There is no dictate of Nature which aſcribes a greater Authority to a Multitude <hi>as ſuch,</hi> than to one individual Perſon.

The Men leavened with this Principle laying great ſtreſs on Human Contracts and Agreements in all probability, will aſſign compact as the Ground or Cauſe of this pretended real Majeſty. Now I think it is a very reaſonable Requeſt to deſire them to inform us, what that compact is which produceth and conſtituteth this real Majeſty? Or when the Multitude ſo aſſociated did agree and contract, that collectively conſidered they ſhould be the primary Subject of real Majeſty or Sovereign Authority?</p>
            <p>1. It could not before their aſſociation, for antecedently to that they were in a ſtate of diſperſion and could make no Confederacy.</p>
            <p>2. This compact could not be made meerly by their aſſociation; for their aſſociation in its ſelf was not a compact, but a preparative diſpoſition to it.</p>
            <p>3. Neither could this compact be made after their aſſociation; for if it were ſo, then either before they actually formed themſelves into a Governed Society, or elſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>1.

            <p>2. Not after they are actually formed into a Governed Society, becauſe that eſſentially ſuppoſeth Subordination, and conſequently <hi>as ſuch</hi> cannot be that Community, which is the Subject of the real Majeſty, pretended unto in the Objection; for liberty of Perſons and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of Members, are two inſeperable adjuncts of that Community, as the Patrons of this Objection affirm.

Which things premiſed conſidered, I ſhall conclude, that the real Majeſty of a Community ſo termed in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to the Perſonal Majeſty of the Ruling Part, is a meer Figment of ſome ſick brained Pretenders to the Politicks.

This Hypotheſis under conſideration is not only irrational, but contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to its ſelf; for it preſumes, that the real Majeſty of the Community, is an incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble property or right thereof, and yet that it is by paction and conditional donation transferred and delegated to ſome Member or Members thereof, and ſo conſtituted a Perſonal Majeſty. The real Majeſty of the Community, which is the effential Majeſty, by a pactional Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being transfuſed and derived to an individual Member, or ſome Members of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity exiſts a Perſonal Majeſty, which with what depends upon it in the Objection is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently contradictious to its ſelf. For, the real Majeſty of the Community, muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable and ſtill remain entire, or elſe the Perſonal Majeſty cannot be ſubordinated to it, as an accountable and forfeitable Truſt, as theſe Men tell us it is. And had not the real Majeſty of the Community a diſtinct Being and Exiſtence from Superintendency and Supremacy over the Perſonal Majeſty, it could not exerciſe any judicative or executive Power over the Perſonal Majeſty, as the Objectors ſuppoſe it may. How it ſhould be transferred and delegated, and yet be incommunicable I cannot apprehend. If theſe Men will adventure to ſay, that the real Majeſty of the Community is omnipotent, and creates the Perſonal Majeſty at will and pleaſure, and anſwerably can ſo annihilate it, they will ſay ſomething, but yet nothing, but what is ridiculous as well as incredible.</p>

Though this and the former Objection are grounded on Suppoſals equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and falſe, and are equally deſigned to ſubjugate the Sovereign Authority of Princes to the Power of their Subjects, yet like other Errors, they contradict each other; for if all Men be equal by Nature and partake of equal Liberty, then the Aſſociation, or an aſſembly of a Multitude, nor indeed of all the People in the World, cannot by the Law of Nature claim a Superiority over any particular Perſon whatſoever, becauſe the Law of Nature and the Rights thereof are immutable, and conſequently, though a Multitude may by Force ſuſpend and reſtrain the exerciſe of a particular Perſons Rights and Liberties, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly alienate or abrogate them.

Surely (ſay they) the Reſiſtance of a lawleſs Violence and Oppreſſion, is no Reſiſtance of a lawful Authority. And if by many and poſitive expreſs Laws, the Subjects have Properties and Liberties reſerved to them as their Rights, then they muſt have a Right to preſerve them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the illegal Invaſions of the Prerogative, and conſequently may oppoſe Force to Force in ſuch a Caſe.</p>

A Man <hi>as ſuch,</hi> by the Law of Nature may have Liberty to do that, which by the poſitive Law of that Society to which he belongs, may be Treaſon; yea, and which as he is relatively conſidered, may be ſuperceded by a Superiour Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for all private Intereſts being included in the Public, and the Safety of every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Part comprehended in the Safety of the whole, the Reſpect due to the Public and the whole, is to be the Standard and Meaſure, and conſequently to over-rule the Reſpect due to any private or particular ſecurity whatſoever.

If the Authority of Parents will exempt them from the Active Reſiſtance of their Children, why ſhould not alſo that of Magiſtrates exempt them in the like Caſe from the Active Reſiſtance of their Subjects?

For when the Illegal Acts of Sovereign Princes are by Force of Arms reſiſted, Sovereign Princes themſelves as ſuch are alſo reſiſted, becauſe their Perſons and Authority are not actually and indeed divided.
'Tis true, their natural and politic Capacities are diſtinguiſhable in our Conceptions: but

Wherefore though the Perſonal Acts of our Kings are not always Legal Acts, and their Commands conſidered in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Capacities may be ſuch as no good Subject can approve, actively ſubmit unto, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; yet they are ſtill the higher Powers which cannot be reſiſted without the peril of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, becauſe their perſonal Subſiſtences imply an inſeperable Inveſtiture with Sovereign Authority. And therefore my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in <hi>Calvins</hi> Caſe tells us, that the <hi>Natural Legiance</hi> due to our Kings in their Natural Capacities from their Subjects is <hi>abſolute and indefinite, not circumſcribed by Law, but above Law and before Law,</hi> and conſequently <hi>indelible and immutable.</hi>

Becauſe the Authority of our Kings is in their Laws, their Offices, their Courts, where their Perſons are not, ſome think, that their Perſons may be reſiſted and no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance made to their Authority. I would have ſuch to conſider, whence it is, that Laws, Judicial Courts, and Subordinate Officers have their Authority. Is it not Originally from the Authority of the King's Perſon? And are not all the Laws, Courts and Officers of the Kingdom, for that reaſon called the King's Laws, Courts and Officers? And can the King communicate Authority without Authority, firſt inherent in himſelf? Certainly, that muſt needs be the moſt Eminent Authority which is the Source and Fountain of all other Authority, according to that Maxim, <hi>Quicquid efficit tale eſt magis tale.</hi> And if the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Authority of the King be antecedent to that of his Laws, Courts and Officers, and derive to them that Authority they partake of, then I conceive 'twill be no illogical reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to infer, That the Being and Exiſtence of his Sovereign Authority depends not on them. As the King had an Exiſtence before their Conſtitution, ſo he may likewiſe after their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. God forbid, that when a Sovereign Prince hath ſolemnly promiſed and ſworn to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35537:24"/>Govern his Subjects according to his Eſtabliſhed Laws, and to Protect them in their Rights, Properties and Priviledges, that he ſhould violate his Faith thus given to God and his People, yet if he do he is a Sovereign Prince ſtill, and the Reſiſtance of him, a Reſiſtance of the Ordinance of God, becauſe his Authority is from God, and hath no Superior under God to controul it, nor to whom to forfeit, and becauſe the illegal Exerciſe of his Power doth not diſannul his Authority.</p>

This is evident to the common Senſe and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Mankind, from the injurious Sentences that are paſt, and Executions that enſue in all ſorts of Human Judicatures reſpectively to the Lives, Limbs, Liberties and Eſtates of Subjects. The Liberty the Subjects here in <hi>England</hi> have in ſome Caſes to arreſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to appeal from an Inferiour to a Superiour Court, preſumes the Truth of this. Now, though a Sentence contrary to the true Intention of Law be an unjuſt Sentence, and cannot properly have the Authority of the Law in it, yet Subjects in all Parts of the World are obliged by it, till it be reſcinded and reverſed by the Authority of a competent Superiour Judge. And if it be a Sentence paſt or ratified by a Supream Judge, from whom there is no appeal, the Subject can have no redreſs, but is finally concluded by it how illegal and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſoever it be, hence that, <hi>Etiam cum Praetor iniquum pronunciat, jus dicit;</hi> Which is a further Evidence, that there is an Authority in Perſons Superiour to that in Laws. 'Tis from the Authority of the Perſon and not of the Law, that a Sentence pronounced accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law, binds in ſome Caſes and not in others; and a Sentence pronounced againſt Law is reverſible in ſome Caſes and not in others. Indeed, 'tis plain, that a Sentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced contrary to the End and Intention of Law, could have no Authority and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Force in it, were it not from the Authority of the Judge whoſe act it is.

That the Right which Subjects have to preſerve themſelves in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and Liberties againſt the unjuſt and violent Invaſions or Uſurpations of the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, cannot authorize or warrant them to an active and forcible Reſiſtance thereof. For though the higher Powers are not Commiſſioned to do illegal, out-ragious and deſtructive acts of violence, yet they are the higher Powers by Commiſſion, and therefore, though they abuſe their Power, the Subjects being no competent Judges thereof, they are to be ſubmitted unto without Reſiſtance. The High Prieſt and Elders of the People, had no legal Authority to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and ſecure Jeſus Chriſt as a Criminal, and yet he condemned St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s forcible Reſiſtance thereof. So when the High Prieſt commanded St. <hi>Paul</hi> to be ſmitten contrary to the Law, he acknowledged, that notwithſtanding that injurious violence offered to him, he had no warrant to revile him, much leſs violently reſiſt him, and return blow for blow. So that, thoſe Acts of the higher Powers which are done without Law and againſt Law, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered conjunctively with the Authors or efficient Cauſes of them, they imply the Preſence of a Sovereign Authority with them which is uncontrollable and irreſiſtible.</p>

Another Objection which very naturally offers it ſelf from what was laſt ſaid, is this; if the very Illegal Acts of all Sovereign Powers be uncontrollable and irreſiſtible, then a Deſpotical is not Diſtinguiſhable from a Political Government, nor an Arbitrary from a Legal Power, nor an Abſolute Monarchy from a Monarchy regulated and limited by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed Laws; becauſe the Authority of the one in effect is of equal extent with the other, and the one as unaccountable and irreſiſtble, if he make his Will his Law, as the other.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35537:24"/>a Political, Legal, limited Government hath much advantage and profit every way above that which is Deſpotical, Abſolute and Arbitrary; and therefore no Man which wiſheth well to his Country, and ſincerely deſires the Safety, eaſe and contentment either of the Sovereign or his Subjects will contribute in the leaſt Degree, any Aſſiſtance by word or deed towards the Abolition of the former and Introduction of the latter: but yet ſuppoſing the Sovereign Power of the latter irreſiſtble, and the Sovereign Power of the former reſiſtible by the Subjects thereof, and it will be the moſt deſirable, becauſe it is inveſted with an unappealable Authority, and conſequently is ſufficiently provided for the Deciſion and Determination of all Controverſies, and the Preſervation of the Peace of the Community, which is not the Caſe of the other, as hath been formerly obſerved.

Though a Political Prince who is obliged to regulate his Power by his known Laws made and Eſtabliſhed with the Conſent and Approbation of his Subjects, may from a preſumption of the uncontrollableneſs and irreſiſtibility of his Power, abuſe his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Arbitrary Adminiſtrations thereof, governing as if his private Will, and not his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Laws were to be the Meaſure of his Government, yet this cannot alter the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Conſtitution of the Government, and make his Will a Law to his Subjects: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though they muſt not actively reſiſt his Power, yet they are not obliged actively to own and obey it. And 'tis very improbable, that any Prince in the World, who is well in his Wits, will augment his Power by Uſurpation, when his Government will be as ſafe by a Legal Adminiſtration, endeavour to obtain any End of Government by Force, and againſt the Conſent of the Subjects, which is obtainable by Law and with their Conſent. Princes ordinarily are not ſo meanly skilled in the Politics, but they know and conſider too, <hi>That he hath moſt Power over his Subjects, who is moſt powerful in them.</hi> And in truth, all the Strong Holds in a Kingdom, will have nothing of Security in them for the Sovereign, when he hath diſmantled this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 92. 2. Though a Political as well as a Deſpotical Prince can do no wrong, which is cenſurable and puniſhable by any Human Law; (for though he be obliged in Honour, Equity and Conſcience to Conduct himſelf and Adminiſtrations by the directive Power of the Law, yet he is not under the corrective and coercive Power of it, not only becauſe he who can make and repeal the Law, and pardon the Tranſgreſſion thereof is greater than the Law and above it, but alſo becauſe he hath no Superiour to judge and execute any legal puniſhment on him) yet thoſe Commiſſioned by him, are accountable and puniſhable for Illegal Adminiſtrations, and cannot ſerve his private Will contrary to his Laws, without expoſing themſelves to the Condemnation of evil doers. And though the King may for a Time interpoſe an Illegal Exerciſe of his Power to ſuſpend the Law, and to defend and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue then from the Coaction and Vengeance of it, yet he may after due conſideration of the Nature of the Thing, prefer the Honour of his Government, before the Protection of the Tranſgreſſors of his Law, and chuſe rather to juſtifie his Legal Will, than to ſhew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to his Paſſionate Humor. And in caſe ſuch Malefactors ſhould eſcape Condign Puniſhment during the whole Reign of the Prince that employs them, yet 'tis great odds but his Succeſſor to ſhew the Value he ſets on his Laws, his readineſs to redreſs the Grievances of his Subjects from former Male-adminiſtrations of Government, and to ingratiate himſelf with them as all over of Righteouſneſs, and tender of their Legal Liberties, will offer them as a Sacrifice to public juſtice. And therefore not only all honeſt Men, but alſo all worldly wiſe Men, and Men of Fortunes will upon this account take heed how they engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Execution of the King's Will againſt his Laws. I do not doubt but the Kings

The King himſelf ought not to be under Man, but under God, and under the Law, becauſe the Law makes the King.</hi> His meaning is not that the King derives his Authority <hi>as King</hi> from the Law, for then the Principal Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of Governing Adminiſtrations, would owe its being to the Inſtrumental Cauſe thereof: but the true Intent of that learned Author, and of <hi>Fleta</hi> too, who concurs with him in that expreſſion is this, that the Law declares and publiſheth to the Subject who is their rightful King, and ſo ſupports and maintains him <hi>as King</hi> in their acknowledgments, and by the Obſervation of which he diſtinguiſheth himſelf from a Tyrant, who Governs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due regard had to Law. And in this reſpect I think my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſpake not amiſs when he told King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, <hi>That the Law ſate the Crown upon his Head.</hi> And there is no ſuch ready Way to keep and hold the Crown there as to keep and hold faſt to that Law which ſate it there.</p>

Another Objection againſt Non-reſiſtance, and to warrant and encourage the taking of Arms againſt the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> in caſe they exceed their limited bounds, is this; The Supreme Power muſt ſtill be ſuppoſed to be lodged with the legiſlative Power, and not with the executive Power, when that is appropriated to a diſtinct Subject from the Legiſlative. Now 'tis certain, that the executive Part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſingly in the King; ſo that, the whole Adminiſtration of that is in him: but the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative is lodged between him and the Two Houſes of Parliament; ſo that the Power of making and repealing Laws is not ſingly in the King, but only ſo far as the Two Houſes concur with him: Wherefore, the Power of the King is fiduciary only, nothing but a Truſt; and all Truſts (ſaith this Author) by their nature import, that thoſe to whom they are given are accountable, and conſequently, cenſurable and puniſhable; and therefore, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> may be reſiſted with force of Arms and depoſed, and then dealt withal, if under equal guilt, as other Criminals guilty of the moſt Capital Offences.</p>

All the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are the King's Laws, receive their denomination from him only; and therefore, all offences committed againſt them are principally and ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately ſaid to be committed againſt the King, and his Crown and Dignity: for although the Matter (perhaps) of all Laws in ſome latter Ages is prepared by the Two Houſes of Parliament, and no Law is, or can be enacted without their concurrent Approbation and Conſent, yet every Law receives its formal Being and Obligation, from the Authority of the King only, and no Law is repealed but by his Authority only: <hi>The Authority of the Two Houſes is the Authority of Councellors, and not of Legiſlators,</hi> as <hi>Judge Jenkins</hi> ſaith: and Sir <hi>W.

            <p> 1. If we conſider what the Laws determine, we ſhall find that they aſcribe it wholly to the King. See to this purpoſe the afore-quoted Preface to a Statute in 24. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. where
'tis thus ſaid, <hi>For by divers, Old, Authentick Hiſtories and Chronicles it is manifeſtly declared and expreſſed, that this Realm of</hi> England <hi>is an Empire, and ſo hath been accepted in the World, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by our Supreme Head and King, having the Dignity and Royal Eſtate of the Imperial Crown of the Same; unto whom a Body Politick, compact of all ſorts and degrees of People, divided in Terms, and by Names of Spiritualty and Temporalty, have been bounden, and ought to bear next to God na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and humble Obedience, he being alſo in Statute, and furniſhed by the Goodneſs and Sufferance of Almighty God (not of the People with Plenary) whole and entire Power, Preheminence, Authority, Prerogative and Juriſdiction, to render and yield Juſtice, and final determination — in all Cauſes, Matters and Debates:</hi> Likewiſe in the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 35 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> this Submiſſion after Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity to divine Service, is to be made openly in ſome Church, <hi>I do acknowledge and teſtify in my Conſcience, that no other Perſon hath, or ought to have any Power or Authority over [His] Majeſty:</hi> Which Statute was declared to be in full force in the 16 of <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>2. This Authority and Preheminence (as the former Statute mentioned implies) is of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial Cuſtom and Preſcription, and was (ſo far as I can diſcover) never queſtioned in any Parliamentary Convention of the States till 1642. and then by the Two lower States only too: and then the Co ordination in the Legiſlative Power was aſſerted, to warrant and juſtify one of the moſt unreaſonable and barbarous Rebellions that ever was in this Kingdom: 'Tis declared by the Statute of 16 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Crown of</hi> England <hi>hath been ſo free at all times, that it hath been in no earthly Subjection, but immediately ſubject to God in all things, touching the Regality of the ſame Crown, and to none other,</hi> and if, <hi>to none other,</hi> then not to the Two Houſes of Parliament: and in 1 <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. <hi>The High Court of Parliament, wherein</hi> (as they ſpeak) <hi>the whole Kingdom in Perſon or Repreſentative was preſent</hi> (i. e. <hi>all Eſtates and Degrees) call themſelves his Majeſty's Loyal and Faithful Subjects, and declare his Majeſty to be their only Liege Lord and Sovereign, and agnize their conſtant Faith, Obedience and Loyalty to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty

            <p>3.

I know our Author ſuppoſeth the King in his Political Capacity, to be in another conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detation thereof inferior to the Two Houſes of Parliament, though he will not perhaps ſay he is ſo in his Legiſlative, <hi>viz.</hi> as the Executive part of Government is lodged ſingly in him; becauſe this (as he teacheth) is a Matter of <hi>Truſt</hi> derived from the Legiſlative part, for which he is accountable; and in that capacity the King is a <hi>Subject</hi> to the <hi>Two Houſes of Parliament.</hi> Right Excellent! indeed, this is not in terms aſſerted, but 'tis plainly the intent and drift of it: Well! let it be ſuppoſed, <hi>That the Executive Power of the Kingdom is a Truſt from the Legiſlative Power;</hi> will it not then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the King derives a Truſt to himſelf? certainly (if this Author himſelf may be believed) he hath a ſhare in the Legiſlative Power; and therefore if a Truſt be transferred and devolved from thence to him, it muſt be with his concurrence as acting in that capacity: Now if he ſhould chance to be unfaithful to himſelf and violate this Truſt, to whom in a judiciary way muſt he be accountable? of whom muſt that Court be conſtituted that muſt queſtion the Matter? there may be no Houſes of Parliament in being: and if there be, if he diſguſt their proceedings, may he not Adjourn, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue, or Diſſolve them if he think fit, and what will become of the Matter then? 'tis but equal, that if all intereſted in the Legiſlative Power be concern'd, the King himſelf ſhould be admitted of the <hi>Quorum,</hi> when this matter of Truſt comes to be queſtioned and debated. I conceive the Vanity of this pretence, <hi>That the Executive part of Government is an accountable Truſt committed by our Laws to the King,</hi> will evidently appear to any impartial Man that will but try how to anſwer theſe few plain Queſtions. 1. If this Truſt be abuſed, is it any part of the Executive Power of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Summon, Try, Judge and Puniſh the Abuſer thereof? 2. In whoſe Name ſhall the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for Summons be iſſued forth in order to his Tryal. 3. What proviſion hath the Law made for the Arreſting of the King's Perſon, to ſecure his forth coming to Tryal, in caſe he refuſe to obey a preceptive Summons? 4. Is it not High Treaſon to impriſon the King, or by force to take him into a Man's Power, yea, or but to manifeſt ſuch a Deſign by ſome overt act? 5. If he have a fair Tryal according to Law, he muſt be tried by his Peers, I pray, who are they? 6. Who ſhall be his Judge and paſs Sentence? 7. What is the Puniſhment the Law hath ordained for the abuſe of this Truſt? 8. Who ſhall execute the Sentence pronounced againſt him? 'Tis manifeſt, the whole Adminiſtration of the Executive Power (being confeſſedly lodged in the King, nothing of this can
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35537:28"/>legally be done, and therefore 'tis impoſſible that the King's Executive Power ſhould be a Truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him by his Houſes of Parliament, for which he ought to be accountable to them or any other earthly Power. I hope, you would not have our High and Mighty Sovereign Lord, <hi>the good People of England</hi> erect an <hi>High Court of Juſtice,</hi> which ſhall be inſtead of Delators, Witneſſes, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Peers, Judges and Executioners. I am taught by ſome that underſtood the Conſtitution and Laws of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> very well, that the King is not accountable for his Office or Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to any Court, Perſon or Perſons whatſoever; and every Man that will but attentively read the <hi>Spencer</hi>'s Caſe, and the Tryals of the Regicides may learn the ſame Leſſon: And thus ſaith the moſt learned <hi>Bracton, Sunt ſub Rege liberi homines &amp; ſervi; &amp; omnis ſub eo eſt, &amp; ipſe ſub nullo, niſi tantum ſub Deo. Si à Rege petatur (cum Breve non currat contra Regem) locus erit ſupplicationi, quod factum ſuum corrigat, emendet; ſi non fecerit, ſatis erit ei ad paenam, quod Dominum expectet ultorem, de chartis Regiis, &amp; factis Regum, nec privatae perſonae, nec Juſticiarii debent diſputare. There are Free-men and Servants under the King, and every one is under him, and he is under no one, but under God only: If any thing be to be demanded of the King (ſince a Writ cannot go forth againſt the King) there will be place for petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he would correct and amend his doing; if he do not, it will be Puniſhment enough for him, that he expect the Lord to be the Avenger; of the Royal Grants and Actions of the King neither private Perſons or Judges ought to diſpute;</hi> much leſs to cenſure and chaſtiſe: And my <hi>Lord Coke</hi> in his <hi>Compleat Copy Holder</hi> hath taught me, <hi>That the King repreſenteth God's Perſon on Earth:</hi> And I preſume, no Man is ſo daringly bold as to affirm, That God is accountable and cenſurable for any of his doings.</p>

'Tis ſaid, <hi>That while Eliſha ſate in his Houſe with the Elders, the King ſent a Man from before him: but 'ere the Meſſenger came to him, he ſaid to the Elders, See how this Son of a Murtherer hath ſent to take away my Head: look when the Meſſenger cometh, ſhut the door and hold him faſt at the door:</hi> Hence they infer, that for the Preſervation of our Lives from the illegal Perſecution of the Higher Powers, we may make an active Reſiſtance againſt them, and thoſe commiſſioned by them: but the Matter duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, we ſhall find, that the Premiſes are not of ſufficient ſtrength to ſupport the Concluſion. For, 'tis manifeſt from the Text, that <hi>Eliſha</hi> in this very buſineſs acted Prophetically, becauſe by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary inſtinct and ſuggeſtion he diſcerned the Meſſengers approaching towards him: and by the ſame Prophetick Inſpiration he diſcerned, that <hi>Joram</hi> repented him of his raſh and bloody Command, ſo that, the ſhutting the Door to prevent the Execution of the King's Command, was to fulfil the King's Will as well as to preſerve his own Life and therefore adds as a Reaſon, <hi>why he would have them ſhut the Door, and hold the Meſſenger fast at the Door;</hi> for, <hi>is not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſound of his Maſters feet behind him?</hi> That is, is not the King himſelf following him cloſe at his heels to revoke his cruel Command: and what was done by extraordinary Inſpiration, is to be no rule for ordinary Practice. Moreover, there is a vaſt difference betwixt the Reſiſtance of a particular Act ariſing from a Princes paſſionate Raſhneſs, and a Reſiſtance of a deliberate Act exerciſed from his Office juridically circumſtanced: the former may proceed from Love and Loyalty, <hi>e. g.</hi> when a Subject ſhall interpoſe to withold his Princes hands from murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf or another, or a Woman to defend and preſerve her ſelf from raviſhment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to reſiſt him in a particular unjuſt Act, by ſuch a Force and Violence as implies a nullity in his Regal Power, and is inconſiſtent with a State of Subjection, is utterly forbidden by God: though <hi>Ahab</hi> murdered <hi>Naboth,</hi> and took poſſeſſion of his Vineyard with the higheſt Abuſe of Juſtice in the World, yet that was not a nullifying of his Regal Authority, and could not warrant his Subjects to take Arms againſt him to revenge it.: So every illegal Sentence of Death executed on any Subject in <hi>England,</hi> is a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed, and ſo would the King's ſlaying of an innocent Subject by his own immediate hand, and yet no reſiſtance is to be made in ſuch a Caſe, becauſe God hath expreſly forbid it, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace and Safety is to be preferred before the Preſervation of a particular Perſon, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of a private Injury.</p>

And elſewhere told them, that when they murmured againſt him and <hi>Aaron, your murmurings are not againſt us</hi> (i. e. only) <hi>but against the Lord,</hi> Ex. 16.8. <hi>i. e.</hi> principally and eſpecially. So God himſelf ſaid to <hi>Samuel,</hi> when the People ſtubbornly reſolved upon another manner of Government, than that he had exerciſed over them as to the external Pomp, Grandeur and Succeſſion thereof, <hi>they have not rejected thee, but they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected me, that I ſhould not Reign over them,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.7. which is alſo the Caſe of all Chriſt's Miniſters as Chriſt himſelf aſſured them, Luke 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you heareth me: and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me: and he that deſpiſeth me deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> And elſewhere, Jo. 13.20. <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth whomſoever I ſend, receiveth me: and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that ſent me.</hi> So that, the Officers of God and his Chriſt are as God and Chriſt themſelves, preſentiate or repreſent them, exerciſe not their own but their Authority; and therefore the Deſpiſers and Reſiſters thereof, are Deſpiſers and Reſiſters of the Perſons and Authority of God the Father and Jeſus Chriſt the Son.

Rebellion and Stubbornneſs againſt the King are of the like Nature with the Sins of Witch-craft, iniquity [or Superſtition as ſome Tranſlate it] and Idolatry againſt God, becauſe they partake of the ſame Commerce with the Spirit that worketh in the Children of Diſobedience, alike averſe to Subjection and Obedience to the Inſtitutions and Commands of God, and alike addicted to the vain Imaginations and Reaſonings of their own depraved Minds, and alike reſolved to fulfil their own Wills in contradiction to the Will of God. And as Witch-craft, Superſtition and Idolatry, aſcribe the Honor and Glory that is due to God to another, ſo a Rebellious and Stubborn Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Sovereign Powers, is an uſurping and arrogating of that Superiority and Vindicative Authority over the Sovereign Powers which belongs to God alone, the Subjects aſſuming the Glory of the Divine Authority, and punitive vengeance to themſelves; and when Offenders are under the like Guilts, they muſt expect the like Alotment of Puniſhment. And accordingly <hi>Vatablus</hi> on the Place thus Paraphraſeth it, <hi>Tam grave peceatum est, &amp; tam gravis punitio ei debetur.</hi> So that, if Witch-craft, Superſtition and Idolatry put Men into a State of Damnation, ſo doth Rebellion. And the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Declares in expreſs Terms, <hi>That eternal Damnation is prepared for all impenitent Rebels in Hell with Satan, the firſt Founder of Rebellion and grand Captain of all Rebels.</hi> And cells us, <hi>that the Rebels themſelves are the very Figures of Fiends and Devils</hi> — and as they be <hi>followers of Lucifers Rebellion, ſo ſhall they be of his Damnation in Hell undoubtedly partakers.

And if the Public Adminiſtrations happen to be contrary to their particular humors and private intereſts, and their Perſons fall under any Public Diſgrace, their diſſatisfaction is heightened, and their condition becomes intolerable to them; and their only Remedy to eaſe themſelves, and have their Wills, is to riſe up againſt the higher Powers, and to contend with them for the Preheminence. And what is this but a Contention with God to have their Wills, in contradiſtinction to his Will? They will not allow the Lord of all Things to do with his own as he pleaſeth; but they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto God how and where to place them, and will not be pleaſed unleſs God value them, and prefer them according to that rate they ſet on their own worth and ſerviceableneſs.

'Tis the Root of this too. A covetous Man is ever ready to catch what he can, and if he might have his Will, he would have the Poſſeſſion and Power of all that is. And though the impulſes of covetouſneſs are not ſo loud and clamorous, ſo raging and furious as the motions of wrathful paſſions are, yet they are more ſtrong and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable, and not leſs cruel and barbarous, as the inſtances of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> evince. For covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth not only imply the Engagement of the lower and lighter Part of the Affections, which are eager and violent for a Fit, but alſo the deliberate and ſteady-bent of the Will, which is the moſt imperious and ſelf-determining faculty of the Soul. And therefore <hi>he that will be rich,</hi> runs on his Courſe without fear or wit, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. and cares not what legal Eſtabliſhments and Foundations he overturns and removes, ſo he may obtain thoſe Ends, his greedy Appetite faſtens on and purſues.

Rebels aſſemble themſelves in Troops, but not in the Houſe of God. Their Congregations are ſeperations from religious Aſſemblies. Their exerciſes interruptions, yea, diſſolutions of the holy Congregations of the Faithful. When they meet the Shepherds are divided from their Flocks, and their Flocks ſcatter'd and perhaps butcher'd, and their Sanctuaries laid waſt and made deſolate. And when Men, like <hi>Cain, go out from the Preſence of the Lord,</hi> wilfully excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate themſelves from the ordinary and ſtanding means of Salvation, we have no reaſon to think, that God will by a miraculous Act of Sovereign Grace, deliver them from damnation.</p>

Whereas their hearts are ſet upon miſchief, cover red Inclinations with a pale Face, and under ſpecious Pretences of defending and preſerving the public Safety and Welfare, creep into opportunities to hazard and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them.

A manifeſt endeavour to undermine the reputation of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Government, in the Opinion of his Subjects, and to bring his Perſon into diſgrace as one not well affected to juſtice and the public welfare, and conſequently not ſo fit for Government as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

Which is an Artifice to expoſe them to the malevolent jealouſies and contempt of their Subjects, the readieſt way to undermine and weaken their Authority and Power, and to debaſe and deſtroy their Perſons. For when they are libelled, traduced, arraigned and ſentenced in their Subjects thoughts, affections and judgments, and become deſpiſed Perſons and Miniſters of Government, and have no reſpect or awe in their Subjects hearts, their hands will eaſily be engaged againſt them, to fight them out of the Throne, and to baniſh them out of all their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.

Rebels will revenge evils feared, as well as evils inflicted. They are as impatient under the Belief of a plotted Miſchief againſt them, as of one executed upon them. And indeed, more often rebel and reſiſt to prevent a conceited, contrived Evil, than to remove a real Evil endured: And God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving expreſly forbidden us to reſiſt Evil, and avenge our ſelves, becauſe vengeance is his peculiar, a part of diſtributive Juſtice which alone belongs to him, and ſuch as are Commiſſioned by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. and 13.4. what a notorious Uſurpation is Rebellion upon the Prerogative Royal of God himſelf, which forceth the Sword out of Gods band, to turn it againſt thoſe, into whoſe hands God himſelf hath put it for the Conſervation of human Societies, and Guardianſhip of Laws and good Order.

The Prophet tells the <hi>Heads of the Houſe of Jacob, and the Princes of the Houſe of Iſrael, that they abhorred judgment, and perverted all equity, and built up Sion with Blood, and judged for reward; and yet they leaned upon the Lord, and ſaid, is not the Lord amongſt us, and none evil can come upon us,</hi> Mic. 3.9, 10, 11. thus rebellious <hi>fools rage</hi> againſt God and his ſubſtitutes, and <hi>are confident,</hi> Pr. 14.16. preſume they ſhall ſpeed well, though God hath as expreſly forbid them to do, what they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves to do, as he did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when he ſaid to them, Deut. 1.41. <hi>Go not up, neither fight, for I am not among you,</hi> and like thoſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they refuſe to be convinced of the Evil of their Engagments, and go on preſumptuouſly in their Rebellion, as if God had a great Favour for them, and were obliged to bleſs them with Succeſs, encouraging themſelves herein, by reflecting on thoſe eminent deliverances and victories God vouchſafed to his choiceſt Servants in his own Cauſe. Which is a tempting of God with ſuch pride and ſtoutneſs of heart (<hi>Iſ.</hi> 9.9. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10.) as incenſeth him to ſuch a Degree againſt them, that his jealouſie even ſmoaks againſt them for it; ſo that, <hi>He lays all the Curſes that are written in his Book upon them, and will blot out their Names from under Heaven,</hi> Deut. 29.19, 20. Now a rebellious Reſiſtance being concatenated and muſtered with ſuch a Troop of damning Sins, is it not reaſonable to believe and affirm, that they which ſo reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</p>

Let us conſider the ſinful Evils which are the Effects and conſequential Attendants of a rebellious Reſiſtance, and they will further diſcover the hainous Nature thereof. St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>That where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evil work,</hi> ch. 3.16. and what can be more miſchievous and pernitious in its influences and effects, than that which hath for its train and retinue <hi>Confuſion and every evil work?</hi> That which puts all out of order, and introduceth nothing but what is done amiſs, is evil without a Parrallel. The miſchievous Effects and Conſequences of other Sins are confined to ſome particular Region, but theſe diffuſe and ſpread themſelves through the Univerſe, ſet on Fire the whole Courſe of Nature, diſturb and unſettle both Church and State. That I may the more diſtinctly and ſatisfactorily ſhew you the abominable Effects and Conſequences of a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Reſiſtance, I ſhall reduce them to two general Heads of Things, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſuch as reſpect Matters of Religion and Piety towards God; and then to ſuch as reſpect Matters of Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Intereſts of Human Societies and Individual Perſons.</p>

'Tis in its ſelf a plain and open confronting of the Authority and Ordinance of God, and directly repugnant to the Spirit of Chriſtianity, which is a Spirit of love, order, unity, peace, ſelf-denial, humility, meekneſs, gentleneſs, clemency, patience, long-ſufferance and goodneſs; and therefore muſt neceſſarily weaken and ſhake off, at leaſt in a very conſiderable Degree, the awes and reſtraints of God and Conſcience. It makes Men ſelf-willed, and gathers their moſt exorbitant Paſſions into a Storm, and their pride, ambition, covetuouſneſs, envy, malice, hatred, diſcontent and all other dependant boiſterous Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, evaporate and break forth like Whirle-winds and Thunder-bolts, and ſhake, if they do not overturn, the very Foundations of Piety and Morality, as well as of Policy and Civility; and renders their Appetites as boiſterous and licentious as their Paſſions, which eagerly and inſatiably crave, and purſue things pleaſing and agreeable to their humors and imagined Intereſts, without any regard had to the Meaſures of Piety, Righteouſneſs, Charity, Sobriety and common Honeſty. And when Men are acted and governed by Self-will, Paſſion, Appetite and unreaſonable Intereſt of what account is Religion? Follow theſe Men in their Marches, obſerve them in their Quarters, and attend them in their general Deportments, and you ſhall find their private Devotions few, and their public leſs. And though ſometimes they pretend to fight for Religion, yet in their actual hoſtile Engagments and Battles, they mind and intend more the Preſervation of their Bodies and deſtruction of their Enemies, than they do the honour of God and ſalvation of their Souls, as their Conſciences will witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. When the Government of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſuſpended from the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but for forty days they Carved themſelves a Molten Image, and worſhipped it as a God, <hi>Ex.</hi> 32.4, 6. and no ſooner was his immediate Succeſſor, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> dead, and thereby an exemption from the reſtraints of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment preſumed, but <hi>Micah</hi> and his Mother make them Gods and Prieſts, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.5. and in the

This is an experimented Truth, <hi>cui plus licet quam par eſt, plus velit quam licet, be that may lawfully do more than is fit, he will do more than is lawful,</hi> and 'tis very rare, when Men may do that which is right in their own Eyes, that they do that which is pleaſing and acceptable in the ſight of God.</p>

The Effects and Conſequences of a rebellious Reſiſtance are very pernitious and deſtructive to Matters of Civil Government, the Intereſts of human Societies and individual Men. Every Rebel would be more than a King, for he contends to be higher than the higheſt Powers, countermands their Laws, would correct their Perſons, ſuppreſs and extirpate their Adminiſtrations. And thus the Government is unhinged, <hi>and the People are oppreſſed every one by another, and every one by his Neighbour; the Child will behave himſelf proudly againſt the ancient, and the baſe againſt the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, Iſ. 3.5. <hi>and they that were brought up in Scarlet are brought down to embrace Dung-hills,</hi> Lamb. 4.5. and thoſe not meetly qualified to be Servants, aſſume the Place of Maſters, Lamb. 5.8. <hi>Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand,</hi> was the Complaint of the degraded Elders of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Yea, ſuch is the lawleſs violence of rebellious Aſſailants, that <hi>Mens Children are daſhed in pieces before their Eyes, their Houſes ſpoiled, and their Wives raviſhed, the Women and the Maids,</hi> as the Prophet expreſſeth it, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 13.16. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.11. and how can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, ſince as the Prophet complains, <hi>the Law is no more,</hi> Lamb. 2.9. the reſtraining Force of the Law from the prevalent Force of Arms is as if it were not.

Hence that Proverb <hi>inter arma ſilent leges,</hi> the noiſe of Arms makes the Laws ſpeechleſs, they cannot ſpeak out and utter themſelves to the purpoſes of Government. And what ſecurity can Men have for their Lives, Liberties, Properties and Relatives, when there is no Law to protect them, nor Ruling Power to Guard them? Well therefore might our Saviour ſay, <hi>a Kingdom divided against it ſelf is brought to deſolation,</hi> Mat. 12.25. diſſolution ever was, and will be, the iſſue of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion.

Every Man hath an imperious heart, would judge and determine for himſelf, and is ſo fondly and partially addicted to himſelf and his eſpouſed Intereſts, that if left to himſelf, he would aſſume to himſelf more Rights and Liberties than to come his ſhare; and therefore, if every one who pretends to a Liberty of Thinking ſhould obtain a Liberty of Acting, and do that which is right in his own eyes, without having any Rulers or Laws over him, to reſtrain and correct him, who could be ſecured from Wrong and Oppreſſion? ſuch a State of Liberty would render every Man an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to every Man, and in reallity a greater Enemy to himſelf, than to any Man elſe, becauſe it would enſnare him in licentiouſneſs, and be ſo far from a State of Liberty, that it would be a State of the greateſt Confuſion and Servitude in the World. Subjection therefore, under the moſt corrupt and tyrannical Government, is more tollerable and deſirable than freedom in ſuch a State of Anarchy and Confuſion: For though the former, like a Tempeſt, may do conſiderable miſchief here and there in ſome particular Caſes and Inſtances, the latter, like a Deluge or epidemical Diſeaſe, will carry down and deſtroy all that ſtand before it. And thus it was determined by <hi>Fronto</hi> the <hi>Conſul</hi> in <hi>Nerva</hi>'s Reign, <hi>Melius eſt ſub his eſſe, ſub quibus nihil licet, quam ſub quibus omnia, 'tis better to be ſubject unto them, under whom nothing is lawful, than under them under whom all things are lawful:</hi> That is, the ſevereſt Reſtraints are more eligible than a boundleſs Liberty; becauſe, 'tis better and ſafer to be expoſed to the danger of ſuffering than to the danger both of finning and ſuffering. So, that a rebellious Reſiſtance breaking down and levelling the Boundaries of Government and Laws, doth, as it were, let Hell looſe upon us, hearten and encourage all ſorts of licentiouſneſs and wickedneſs amongſt us, and bring us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a kind of preſent Damnation, and fill us with Confuſion and Terror round about.

The next thing to be conſidered, is the Grounds upon which the Decree and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God, to condemn rebellious Reſiſters of the Higher Powers, to an everlaſting deſtruction is founded. <hi>O the Depth</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33, 34.) <hi>both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God, how unſearchable are his Judgments and his Ways paſt finding out! for who hath known the Mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Councellor?</hi> intimating, that it becomes us rather to admire than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Reaſons of his Purpoſes, Ways and Actings For, <hi>He giveth not account</hi> [is not obliged to account] <hi>of any of his matters,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Ch.</hi> 33.13. and therefore, it will be no abſurdity to reſolve the Reaſon of the Matter under conſideration, principally into the Sovereign Council and

So he hath done, even becauſe ſo it pleaſed him to do, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. and this is as firm a Ground as the Mind of Man can reſt or acquieſce on: For God alone knows what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him to do; and we may be ſure that all his Ordinations and Diſpenſations are ſuch as well beſeem his infinite perfection in Knowledge and Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not, will not, cannot, decree or do any thing amiſs.

Act as his Miniſters and Officers, as 'tis, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. and 6. of this Chapter. Wherefore, reſpectively unto God, Obedience is the Duty and Work of all the World: and as all that Authority and Power with which Men are inveſted to make and execute Laws is derived from him, and to be adminiſtred in his Name, ſo all that Subjection and Obedience which is exacted as due thereunto, is from the Conſtitution of <hi>his Will,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.15. and to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and performed for <hi>his ſake, verſ.</hi> 13. or as our Apoſtle in <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. of this Chapter, <hi>for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake,</hi> or from a Senſe of that Duty we owe to the Sovereign Authority and Dominion of God himſelf.
